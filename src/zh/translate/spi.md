Known as the four-wire serial bus, SPI lets you attach multiple compatible devices to a single set of pins by assigning them different chip-select pins.

To talk to an SPI device, you assert its corresponding chip-select pin.

By default the Pi allows you to use SPI0 with chip select pins on CE0 on GPIO 8 and CE1 on GPIO 7.

You can enable SPI1 with a dtoverlay configured in "/boot/config.txt", for example:

```
dtoverlay=spi1-3cs
```

For full details of the SPI dtoverlays (and others) see [the Raspberry Pi dtoverlay README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/firmware/master/boot/overlays/README)
